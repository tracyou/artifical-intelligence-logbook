At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

Waterloo couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo finally facing my Waterloo

I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse

Do I see the signs, I think I see?
Or is this just fantasy
Is it true that the beast is wakin'?
Stirrin' in his restless sleep tonight in the pale moonlight
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along
They drum their drums and look so strong
You'd think that nothin' in the world was wrong
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I won't sing
Let's not look the other way, takin' a chance
'Cause if the bugler starts to play
We too must dance
What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble?
Won't somebody tell me what I hear?
In the distance but drawin' near
Is it only a storm approachin'?
All that thunder and the blinding light in the winter night
In the grip of this cold December
You and I have reason to remember
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
The songs that you and I don't sing
They blow their horns and march along

Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you

I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a landslide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning

Never expecting surprises

Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it
I'm not a coward
Oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong
My friends and my family, this dull little town
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar
I wonder, it's frightening
Leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me

Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone on your bed
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you
But then again you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply but still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave

I'm sorry Cassandra

I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please"

That the true Miss Nobody is me
It's an evil world
That has only made me a girl
I am just a girl
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered, I love you
Darling I could see
I was meant to be your girl
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say
I am just a girl
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I can't believe it's true

He stands
Towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me
I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry
He's dressed
In the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me
On his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry
Agnetha, Frida
High and mighty, his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
To grow in size
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm
And save cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry
Frida
Strange how
Dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No more
Pain as there was pain before
Far away he rambles on
I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry

Came to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man
Like a parish is waiting for the priest
Longed to hear him play

We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon

He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
So they let him play
Play their minds away

Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing

And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

Possibly could release me

Make all my dreams come true
And you ease me
You thrill me, you delight me

I lay my life before you
I'll have you want me more and more

He will drink champagne in his limousine

Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)

And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock 'n roll band
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it
And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wide gorilla
[Chorus:]
We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?
So people get together, gonna have a good time
Everybody listen to the music, yeah
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky

We had a drink in each cafe

You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Are you the hero of my dreams

If we'd stayed to play for fortune
We'd have broke the banks of gold
We'd have taken old Las Vegas
For every cent that she could hold
Love like ours was made in heaven
It was blessed by Lord above
We will spend our lives together
Forever hand in glove
We have both of us between us
Known misfortune in our days
Darling this time, we're on our way
'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
We are here
And here we'll stay
We won't ever throw this love of ours away
'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
We are here
Here we'll stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
'Cause we're here
And here we'll stay
We will never throw this love of ours away
So we are here
And here we'll stay
We will never throw this love of ours away..."

Being part of it, being in it

And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference

The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it

The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)

So much that I wanna say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless

Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate hope
And I cry and I feel like dying
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realise that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times

I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak"

You can see her as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
'Cause I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be
Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella
(just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day
So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store
Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella

And I ain't gonna take it no more

Being myself, having my pride

Hamlet iii part 2
When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground
When the air gets cold
Then I think of us, of you and I
And it almost makes me cry
So sad and kind of bitter sweet
And the memories filled with tears
And I fear my heart will break
Guess it all was my mistake
Autumn's chilling winds were blowing through the trees
And rain fell softly on your face
Oh I remember every little thing about that day
I remember every place
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds
And rain fell softly on your face
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
Det rÃ¤cker dÃ¤r
Ja
Nu hÃ¶r jag alltsÃ¥ vÃ¤ldigt lite frida!
Free as a bumble bee
I'm down
And I feel depressed
Sitting here
Just waiting
For next bus traveling
Down town
It's a cry and a shame
Isn't it
A beautiful weather?
If I could have my way
Well, I would not be working
On a day like this
I know what I like to be
As free
As a bumble bee
Take a zip of
Every flower
Free
As a bumble bee
What a way
Each lazy hour
What a good life
Lying laid back
Like an old railroad bum by the track
What a good life
Living outdoors
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw
Rubber ball man
A poster on the wall
Of a dear friend
I wish there was a way that I could show you
How your songs set me free
The hero of them all
You're a legend
I guess I never get a chance to know you
Still you're close as can be
Make the band stand
To a dream land, rubber ball man
Clapping your hands
And your feet dance, rubber ball man
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still
Some of us screaming
Some of us dreaming
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Look at your fans
How we love you, rubber ball man
Crying over you
I'm waiting for you, baby
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you
I'm waiting for you, baby
I'm sitting all alone
I feel so cold without you
It chills me to the bone
I never thought you'd leave me
But now I know it's true
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you
Crying over you
I'm crying over you
Crying over
Little memories
Of things we used to do
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you
Oh, lord I'm blue
I'm crying over you

How it did embarrass me
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

Just like that
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned
And once again, the river's flowing slowly
Following the same and uneventful course
Now the tears have dried
It's become a pleasant break
I recall without remorse
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit
He had something that I miss
I guess he was a rolling stone
The only one I've known

With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine

And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace

Each time that he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says that's all very fine

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defenses breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart?
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He saw my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how
Now this is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
'Cause waiting at the answer to his questions is a definite blow
I'm kind of certain that's the truth
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what could happen
Where I'd be if I fell

About to crack, defenses breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart?
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart

Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music

She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came
Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

130970,130970,al-andar,1981,abba,Pop,"They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.
A voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside.
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
I've always tried.
Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)
Being part of it (la la la la)
Being in it (la la la la)
With the urge to move on
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)
Being in it
With the urge to move on
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la
Like a wind that's always blowing
La la la la la la-la
La la la la la la-la (life is flowing)
La la la la-la (move on)
Like the sunrise in the morning
La la la la la la-la
La la la la la la-la (life is dawning)

I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Where they play the right music

You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance
You can jive
Having the time of your life
See that girl
Watch that scene
Dig in the dancing queen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance

There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet"
