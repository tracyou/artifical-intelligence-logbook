And they crawl around
Walkin' sideways
Sideways walkin'
Gives me the blues
And then you start to scratch
And they start to hatch
Walkin' sideways
Sideways walkin'
Gives me the blues
Oh, and when they start to bite
Then it's time you saw the light
For an appointment
Before you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
Well the doctor said
We got to make 'em dead
Stops 'em walkin
Sideways walkin'
Gives me the blues
Oh, and when you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
And when they start to itch
You go out and you take a bitch
For an appoinment
Well you rub it on
And you rub it in
Stops em walkin'
Sideways walkin'

They got the blues.

229974,229974,carry-me-home,2009,ac-dc,Rock,"The bartender's working on a late night shift
Cheap bums and blondes and barmaids on a midnight drift.
And the dance band's playing the same old slam
I'm sinking whiskey and you're sipping fine wine
I don't know what it is you're trying to prove
Well it should be you but it's me who can hardly move
And I've got my reputation lying on the line
Come on baby, be a good dog and help the blind
Oh won't you carry me home
Won't you carry me home
Won't you carry me home
(like a truck, pick me up)
You ain't no lady but you've sure got taste in men
That head of yours has got you by time and time again
My arms and legs are aching and my head's about to blow
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show
But I've just spent next weeks wages and I'm right out of coin
But you want more and it's half past four and they want to close the joint
But we can't afford a taxi, and it's too late for the bus
But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I can trust
Carry me home
Oh won't you carry me home
Ohh! Carry me home
(don't let me lie here in all this beer)
You drank all your booze and half of mine
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine (to come and kill me)
Just like the man who threw me on the floor
Don't matter, while I'm down here I might as well try and find the fucking door
Excuse me, have you seen it? it's about this big
And have you got a plastic bag 'cause I'm gonna be sick
I'm dead drunk and heave'n hanging upside down
And you're getting up and leaving, you think I'm gonna drown
Carry me home
Yeah won't you carry me home
(I need your help)
Carry me home
Carry me home
Oh won't you carry me home
Yeah carry me home"

When you smile I see sunrise
And I know you've been thinking of me
And I know how you want it to be
Oh Jean
I can tell by the things you say
I can tell that you know the way
And I know what you want me to do
Oh, I've got hearts and flowers for you
If you leave me you'll make me cry

For their lives on the street
Where they happened to meet

We all came down from montraux,on the lake geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile,we didn't have much time
Frank Zeffer and among others,were at the best place around
Till some stupid with a flaregun,he burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water,fire in the sky,smoke on the water
They burnt down the gamblin house,it died with an awful sound
Funky claude was runin in and out,pulin kids from the ground
When it all was over,we had to find another place
Swiss time was runin out fast,we're gona lose our race
Smoke on the water,fire in the sky,smoke on the water
(Guitar Solo)
We ended up at the grand hotel,it was empty cold and bare
With the rolling truck stones just outside,we made our music there
A few old red lights and a few old beds,we made a place to sweat
Well no matter what we get out of this,well i know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water,fire in the sky,smoke on the water

I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much
She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder and lightening start
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

He said
Let there be sound, and there was sound
Let there be light, and there was light
Let there be drums, and there was drums
Let there be guitar, and there was guitar
Let there be rock
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
An the guitar man got famous
The businessman got rich
And in every bar there was a super star
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers picking
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Let there be rock

There was a ninety two decibel rocking band
The music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd

Was blowing up a storm

There were fifteen million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers picking
And this is what they had to say

Underneath that old apple tree,
Sitting with a handful of flowers,
Looking as cool as can be.
We talked away a couple of hours,
Then she laid her hand on my lap,
Oh, I thought I got to be dreaming,
I didn't know I fell in her trap.
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say,
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play.
She was a Soul Stripper, she took my heart,
Soul Stripper, she took my heart,
Soul Stripper, and tore me apart.
She started moving nice and easy,
Slowly getting into my spine,
Killing off this nice little feeling,
Ooooh, everyone she could find.
And when she had me hollow and naked,
That's when she put me down,
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me,
Stuck it in and turned it around."
